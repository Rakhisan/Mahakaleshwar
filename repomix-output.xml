# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

          <h3>Historical Background</h3>
          <p>
            The Mahakaleshwar temple is believed to have been originally
            constructed by King Chandrasena and later renovated by several
            rulers over centuries, especially during the Maratha period. The
            temple holds immense historical and spiritual value as one of the 12
            sacred Jyotirlingas in India.
          </p>

          <h3>Design & Layout</h3>
          <p>
            The temple follows a multi-level structure with the sanctum located
            underground, an upper section for regular worship, and a Sabha
            Mandap (assembly hall) adorned with finely carved pillars. The
            central spire (Shikhara) rises elegantly above the sanctum,
            capturing the essence of ancient Indian temple architecture.
          </p>

          <h3>Symbolism & Craftsmanship</h3>
          <p>
            Each element of the temple's design reflects spiritual symbolism.
            The motifs, sculptures of deities, and carvings of mythological
            tales not only showcase the artistic excellence of the era but also
            convey religious and cultural messages. The temple has been crafted
            using black stone, which adds to its timeless elegance.
          </p>

          <h3>Modern Restoration Efforts</h3>
          <p>
            In recent years, conservation efforts have been initiated to
            preserve the temple's structure and surroundings. These include
            stone polishing, wall stabilization, and improved drainage systems
            to protect the ancient foundation from water damage.
          </p>

          <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The temple is south-facing, which is rare and symbolically
              powerful in Shaivism.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Jyotirlinga is Swayambhu — self-manifested, not installed by
              humans.
            </li>
            <li>
              The temple has multiple shrines dedicated to various deities
              within the same complex.

          <h3>Significance of Bhasma Aarti</h3>
          <p>
            The use of bhasma (cremation ash) symbolizes the ultimate reality of
            physical existence. Lord Shiva is often depicted smeared with
            bhasma, representing his authority over death and time. During this
            aarti, the Shivalinga is decorated with various offerings including
            ash, sandalwood paste, flowers, and milk, while priests chant Vedic
            hymns.
          </p>

          <h3>Timing and Procedure</h3>
          <p>
            The Bhasma Aarti begins at 4:00 AM and lasts for approximately one
            hour. Devotees are advised to arrive by 3:00 AM to secure a place.
            The ritual begins with the awakening of Lord Shiva, followed by an
            elaborate bathing ceremony using milk, curd, honey, sugar, and
            water. The lingam is then adorned with bhasma while sacred mantras
            are chanted.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Attend</h3>
          <p>
            To attend the Bhasma Aarti, visitors need to purchase special
            tickets, which are available at the temple office or online. It's
            advisable to book these tickets in advance, especially during peak
            seasons and festivals. Photography is strictly prohibited during the
            ceremony.
          </p>

          <h3>What to Expect</h3>
          <p>
            The Bhasma Aarti is an intense spiritual experience. The temple is
            filled with the sounds of bells, drums, and Sanskrit chants. The air
            is heavy with incense, and the atmosphere is charged with devotion.
            The ritual concludes with the distribution of prasad to devotees.

          <h3>Maha Shivratri</h3>
          <p>
            Maha Shivratri is one of the most important festivals celebrated at
            the temple. During this festival, devotees gather for night-long
            prayers and offer special rituals to Lord Shiva. The temple is

          <h3>Temple Significance</h3>
          <p>
            Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas,
            considered the most sacred abodes of Lord Shiva. The temple is
            located beside the holy Kshipra river and holds great spiritual
            importance.
          </p>

          <h3>Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            The temple displays a blend of Rajput and Maratha architectural
            styles, with a towering shikhara (spire), intricate carvings, and
            grand entrances. The sanctum houses the Jyotirlinga facing south — a
            unique feature among the 12 Jyotirlingas.
          </p>

          <h3>Daily Rituals</h3>
          <p>
            Various rituals such as Bhasma Aarti, Rudrabhishek, and Shringar
            Puja are performed daily. Devotees can witness these rituals by
            booking slots in advance. Each ritual enhances the temple’s
            spiritual aura.
          </p>

          <h3>Festivals Celebrated</h3>
          <p>
            Major festivals like Maha Shivratri, Navratri, and Shravan Month see
            huge footfall at the temple. Special aartis, processions, and
            cultural events are organized during these periods.

          <h3>Summer (March - June)</h3>
          <p>
            Summers in Ujjain are hot and dry. Temperatures often soar above
            40°C during peak summer months of April and May. Early mornings and
            evenings are relatively comfortable. If visiting during summer, it's
            advisable to carry light cotton clothes, sunscreen, hats, and stay
            hydrated. Temple visits are best scheduled early morning or evening
            to avoid the intense midday heat.
          </p>

          <h3>Monsoon (July - September)</h3>
          <p>
            The monsoon season brings moderate rainfall to Ujjain, turning the
            surroundings lush green. The temperature drops to a comfortable
            range of 25°C to 35°C. While this season offers respite from the
            summer heat, occasional heavy downpours might disrupt travel plans.
            Carry umbrellas, waterproof footwear, and light raincoats if
            visiting during this period.
          </p>

          <h3>Winter (October - February)</h3>
          <p>
            Winter is the most pleasant time to visit Mahakaleshwar Temple. Days
            are sunny with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C, while nights
            can get cooler with temperatures dropping to 8°C to 12°C. Light
            woolen clothes are recommended, especially for early morning Bhasma
            Aarti. The clear skies and comfortable weather make it ideal for
            temple visits and exploring other attractions in Ujjain.
          </p>

          <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
          <p>
            The best time to visit Mahakaleshwar Temple is during the winter
            months (October to February) when the weather is pleasant for
            sightseeing and temple visits. The festive season of Mahashivratri
            (February/March) is special but expect larger crowds. If visiting
            during summer, early morning or evening visits are recommended.

          <h3>Temple Structure</h3>
          <p>The Mahakaleshwar Temple has a unique structure with five levels. The idol of Lord Mahakaleshwar is placed on the lowest level. The temple is one of the few Jyotirlingas where the Shivalinga faces south, which is considered a rare and significant feature. The lingam at Mahakaleshwar is believed to be swayambhu (self-manifested).</p>
          
          <h3>Religious Significance</h3>
          <p>As one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, Mahakaleshwar holds immense religious significance in Hinduism. The temple is mentioned in various ancient texts including the Puranas. It is believed that offering prayers at this temple fulfills one's wishes and cleanses one's soul. The energy of the place is said to be so powerful that it can transform one's life.</p>
          
          <h3>Daily Rituals</h3>
          <p>The temple follows a strict routine of daily rituals. The day begins with the Bhasma Aarti, followed by various poojas throughout the day. The Shivalinga is adorned with different offerings at different times of the day, including milk, water, bel leaves, flowers, and sandalwood paste. The temple also observes special rituals on Mondays and during the holy month of Shravan.</p>
